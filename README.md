# Project Overview
The Tours and Travel CRM is a Salesforce-based solution tailored for global travel agencies to manage their bookings, packages, customers, payments, and internal operations. It aims to address key business challenges such as manual booking processes, ineffective communication, poor tracking of follow-ups, and limited visibility into performance metrics.
With this CRM, agencies can manage diverse trip types (family, solo, corporate), provide country-specific travel packages, automate customer interactions, and monitor employee task performance — all in a centralized system.

# *Phase 1*
In this project, I focused on understanding how tours and travel agencies operate globally—their booking processes, customer relationships, payment tracking, tour coordination, and internal collaboration. These areas often face challenges due to manual workflows and lack of integrated systems. To address this, I gathered information from key stakeholders like travel agents, customer service reps, and finance teams. I also considered the needs of end users to understand what they expect from a CRM system. Pain points—such as delayed communication, manual bookings, and poor feedback tracking—were noted. Resources like ChatGPT, Google, Salesforce Docs, and Trailhead helped shape the direction of the solution.

Key business requirements included handling global bookings, managing various trip types and membership levels, automating updates, and tracking performance metrics like revenue and retention. The CRM had to support the full booking lifecycle—from inquiry to payment and feedback—with features like automation, role-based access, and custom workflows. The main objective was to streamline operations, reduce manual work, and enhance customer satisfaction through automation and personalized experiences. Dashboards and reports would offer valuable insights for management and decision-making.

Security was handled through profiles, roles, permission sets, and sharing rules. Sensitive fields were protected through Field-Level Security, and record access was restricted appropriately—for example, giving guides limited visibility to related customer data.

# *Phase 2*
In this phase, I created and configured core Salesforce objects like Customer Info, BookingGuest, TravelPackage, Booking, BookingPayment, Employee, and Feedback. Each object includes relevant field types—text, number, date, picklist, formulas, lookups, and master-detail relationships—designed to meet the functional needs of a travel booking system. Required fields were defined where critical, such as guest age, number of travelers, or travel package price.

To improve form usability and ensure accurate input, I implemented field dependencies. For instance, in BookingGuest and Employee, the City picklist dynamically updates based on the selected Country. In Booking, the available options for Preferred Accommodation are controlled by the selected Membership. Similarly, in Employee, the Role field adapts based on the selected Department. These dependencies help keep user input clean and context-relevant. 
<p align="center"> <img width="1907" height="811" alt="Booking Guest" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8011f25d-e59e-4185-b494-05361d07cad0" /> </p>
<p align="center"> <img width="1911" height="808" alt="Booking" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2eeb45b5-1df0-4a92-9a8d-ce1f470f41b8" /> </p>
<p align="center"> <img width="1906" height="811" alt="Employee 2" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a574fe9a-883e-4355-bc0d-cc7e496285a9" /> </p>

I applied validation rules across several objects to enforce data integrity. In Customer Info, the phone must be exactly 10 digits, the email must follow a valid format, and the date of birth cannot be in the future. BookingGuest age must be greater than 0, while in Employee, specific roles like Finance or Admin require a valid email, and Guides must have at least one language selected. Bookings must always start with the status “Pending” when created.
<p align="center"> <img width="1907" height="802" alt="Customer Info" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9f7d0f82-5861-40b9-9fdf-bf43f7fec9a7" /> </p>
<p align="center"> <img width="1908" height="806" alt="Booking Guest" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a96f2715-09ef-4d50-aa9e-a7ab9ac6f064" /> </p>
<p align="center"> <img width="1906" height="807" alt="Employee" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a29b8c1d-d25f-44ab-8d87-2992ef8f1fec" /> </p>

An approval process was added to handle booking cancellations. Once a cancellation is submitted with confirmation, the process automatically routes it to a designated approver (e.g., a manager). Depending on whether it's approved or rejected, the system updates the booking’s status and approval fields, and then sends an email to the customer using pre-defined templates. This adds a layer of oversight for critical changes.
<p align="center"> <img width="1904" height="916" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f9cbba28-1c89-40f4-ada0-daff4969ef77" /> </p>

<p align="center"> <img width="1906" height="806" alt="Email Template 2" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6f8754bf-54fb-4289-b33c-264abf974413" /> </p>

Using Flow Builder, I created an automated validation that checks if the number of BookingGuest records exceeds the number of travelers for a booking. If it does, a custom error message is shown, preventing the save. This flow uses record-triggered logic, decision elements, and a text resource to display the message clearly, enforcing business rules in real time without code. A workflow rule was implemented to automatically assign a follow-up task to travel agents when a booking is marked “Completed.” The task reminds the agent to contact the customer for feedback, with the due date set to three days after the travel end date. This helps maintain customer engagement without manual tracking or reminders. One of the Workflow Rules will be displayed below for clarity.
<p align="center"> <img width="1906" height="915" alt="Final Flow Output" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/de59732f-4d19-46ba-8cd3-2e3c47c6a1ca" /> </p>
<p align="center"> <img width="1593" height="805" alt="Workflow Rules 1" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dbbdfecf-57c5-40ae-a16c-6e0d8738c804" /> </p>

I built a process using Process Builder that sets the Booking Status to “Confirmed” as soon as a related Booking Payment is marked as “Completed.” This automation removes the need for staff to manually confirm bookings and ensures that only paid trips are marked as confirmed, supporting a clean workflow.
<p align="center"> <img width="1903" height="830" alt="Process Builder 2" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cdfeeb78-e1b0-434b-a573-34625833fc70" /> </p>

Finally, I used Apex Triggers to perform automation that isn’t possible with clicks alone. The first trigger automatically creates a related Booking Payment record when a new booking is inserted, with a default “Pending” payment status. The second trigger dynamically creates BookingGuest records based on the number of travelers entered in the booking. All logic is stored in a separate BookingTriggerHandler class for clean, reusable code.
<p align="center"> <img width="1905" height="920" alt="Trigger 3" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/00a1bd66-5bc9-4bd2-af43-9d4953ee6d72" /> </p>
<p align="center"> <img width="1906" height="915" alt="Trigger 2" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/611e7066-34be-4e85-b1df-81b46d052c4f" /> </p>
<p align="center"> <img width="1907" height="921" alt="Trigger 1" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/194d390e-83d5-462a-ad3b-90a739d7fc6f" /> </p>

Asynchronous Apex allows you to handle long-running or complex operations in the background, improving performance and avoiding governor limits. In this CRM system, Future Apex is used to automatically send confirmation emails when a booking’s status changes to "Confirmed". A Queueable class handles sending tour reminders three days before the trip, triggered by a Schedulable class that runs daily at 6 AM. For pending payments, a Batch Apex class filters bookings created the previous day with an unpaid status and sends email reminders to customers. This is supported by a Schedulable Apex job that runs daily at 5 AM to automate follow-ups, ensuring timely communication without manual intervention.

# *Phase 3*
A Lightning App is a tailored workspace in Lightning Experience that groups together objects, tabs, and components to streamline user tasks for a specific business function. To create the Tours & Travels CRM app, navigate to App Manager in Setup and click New Lightning App. Name the app "Tours & Travels CRM", upload a relevant logo image, and proceed through the setup steps, accepting the default options for App Options and Utility Items. In the Available Items section, move Customers Info, TravelPackages, Booking, Booking Payments, BookingGuests, Employees, Feedback, Task, Reports, and Dashboards to Selected Items. Assign the app to the System Administrator profile, then click Save & Finish to complete the app creation.

Page Layouts define how data appears to users on a record’s detail page, allowing customization of field visibility, related lists, and UI components. To configure layouts, go to Object Manager in Setup, search for each object (e.g., Customer Info, BookingGuest, TravelPackage, Employee, Booking, Booking Payments, and Feedbacks), and click on Page Layouts. For each object, select its respective layout (e.g., Customer Info Layout), then drag and arrange the fields as required for optimal display and usability. After arranging the fields for each object, click Save to apply the changes. This ensures each record page presents only the most relevant data in a clean, user-friendly format.

<p align="center"> <img width="1905" height="830" alt="Customer Info Layout" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6172c24b-0ab4-4b91-b634-a63d72660a6e" /> </p>

<p align="center"> <img width="1906" height="828" alt="Feedback Layout" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f0a7afdf-036e-45b3-a0b5-79db99c20162" /> </p>

Dynamic Forms allow record pages in Salesforce to be more interactive and user-specific by customizing field visibility based on logic such as profile, values, or record state. In this Tours & Travels CRM project, Dynamic Forms were enabled on the Booking object to show the "Cancellation Date", "Cancel Confirmation", and "Approval Status" fields only when the Booking Status equals "Cancelled". This was achieved by navigating to the record page, clicking the gear icon, editing the page, upgrading the layout to Dynamic Forms, and applying visibility filters to each specific field. The updated layout was saved and activated for both desktop and mobile users.

Users in Salesforce represent individuals with login access to the org. To add a new user (e.g., Michael Jackson), the system admin navigated to Setup > Users and clicked “New User”. Key details such as role (Travel Agent Manager Role), profile (Travel Agent Profile), and license (Salesforce Platform) were specified. It's important to finalize roles and profiles before creating user accounts to ensure proper permission setup.

Reports in Salesforce help visualize and analyze real-time business data. A custom folder titled "Revenue Folder" was created under the Reports tab to store finance-related insights. The folder was shared with the “Travel Agent Manager Role” and “Finance Officer Role” with “View” access. Several reports were then created: (1) The “Monthly Revenue Report” grouped confirmed or completed bookings by travel package and total billing amount (categorized into revenue buckets: Low, Medium, High), and visualized as a pie chart. (2) The “Pending Payments” report identified bookings with a pending payment status. (3) “Top Travel Packages” highlighted the most frequently booked packages by count. (4) The “Employee Role Breakdown” showed employee distribution per role. Users were also encouraged to create five additional reports tailored to their business needs.
<p align="center"> <img width="1905" height="918" alt="Reports Under TNT CRM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/001dc810-557a-406c-86b8-83dfb836801d" /> </p>

Dashboards offer a consolidated visual overview of critical metrics using data from reports. A dashboard titled “Tours & Travels Dashboard” was created to display the Monthly Revenue Report using a dark-themed pie chart. Additional widgets were added based on the reports from earlier, such as pending payments, top travel packages, and employee role breakdown. Users were instructed to build two more dashboards using other custom reports for broader visibility.
<p align="center"> <img width="1903" height="823" alt="Dashboard Layout 1" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/27dd9a48-92d9-46f0-b57b-d1345ca71d6d" /> </p>

Lightning Web Components (LWC) were introduced to enhance user experience with fast, dynamic UI behavior. A component named TravelPackageSelector was developed, allowing users to select a country and automatically view only the travel packages associated with that country, without reloading the page. The backend logic was handled by an Apex controller TravelPackageController, which queried the TravelPackage__c object based on the selected country. The LWC used a lightning-combobox for country selection and displayed the results in a styled card format. Lightning App Pages were utilized to deploy the custom component. Through the Lightning App Builder, a new app page named "Travel Package Selector" was created. The travelPackageSelector LWC was added to the page, saved, and activated for the Tours & Travels CRM app. As a result, users could now access the component directly from the app launcher or within the CRM’s interface, dynamically browsing available travel packages by country.

# *Phase 4*
Field History Tracking was enabled on key fields in the Booking and TravelPackage objects to monitor changes. For Booking, we tracked Number of Travelers, Booking Status, and TravelPackage. For TravelPackage, we tracked Price Per Person and Availability Status. This allows audit trails to be viewed in the object’s History related list.
<p align="center"> <img width="1883" height="832" alt="Field History Tracking" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/18544f4e-c608-4719-820c-70492312a45d" /> </p>

Duplicate and Matching Rules were set up on the Customer Info object to prevent duplicate records. A Matching Rule was created based on exact matches for Email and Phone. Then, a Duplicate Rule was configured using this matching rule to allow and report duplicates, with a custom alert message shown to users.
<p align="center"> <img width="1907" height="827" alt="Duplicate Rules" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/be3bdada-8802-429f-9697-ee13a7730b35" /> </p>

Custom Profiles were created for different job roles by cloning existing platform profiles. Travel Agent, Tour Guide, Finance Officer, Marketing Executive, and Customer Service Rep profiles were given object permissions based on job responsibilities. Session timeout, password policies, and default apps were also customized per profile.
<p align="center"> <img width="1655" height="827" alt="Travel Agent Profile" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9bafab5a-126f-4e40-988a-834fd28ee206" /> </p>

Roles were configured to match the organizational hierarchy. A Travel Agent Manager role was created under CEO, with Travel Agent and Tour Guide under it. Additional roles like Finance Officer, Marketing Executive, and Customer Service Rep were created directly under the CEO. This structure supports record-level access via role hierarchy.
<p align="center"> <img width="1657" height="832" alt="Roles 1" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/300154a8-72eb-441c-964a-9d3a3eeddb73" /> </p>

Permission Sets were used to grant extra access without changing user profiles. A permission set named “Extra Permission For Travel Agent Manager” was created and assigned to allow full CRUD access on the TravelPackage object for relevant users. Sharing Rules were applied to the Customer Info object to support data visibility across roles. The OWD was set to private, and a sharing rule was added to auto-share records owned by Travel Agents with the Tour Guide Role, with Read-Only access.
<p align="center"> <img width="1657" height="832" alt="Sharing Settings" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cc30b951-9c11-432b-b73b-6a0f38abcf14" /> </p>
<p align="center"> <img width="1652" height="827" alt="Sharing Settings 2" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/56652bd6-f992-44fd-bb1b-689f5109a19b" /> </p>

Test Class was created for the Booking trigger and its handler to ensure logic works as expected. The test inserts customer, travel package, and booking records, and verifies that related Booking Payment and BookingGuest records are created correctly. Assertions were included to validate data.
<p align="center"> <img width="1905" height="916" alt="TestClasses - BookingTriggerTest" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e85f6972-133f-4b63-abcf-a74a6e65dbfe" /> </p>
  
Test Cases were documented and executed to confirm functionality. These include creating Customers and Bookings, updating Payment Status to confirm bookings, and sending confirmation emails. Additional test scenarios were covered for flows, automation, and data validation. Edge cases and defects were logged and resolved.
- Test Case: Verify that a new Customer can be created successfully with all mandatory fields.
- Test Case: Verify that a new booking can be created successfully with all mandatory fields.
- Test Case: Verify whether the Booking Status is Confirmed in Booking Object when Payment Status field is updated to completed in Booking Payment Object. And also verify whether the customer received the mail regarding Booking confirmation and payment completed.
- Test Case: Verify that a new travel package can be created successfully with all mandatory fields.
- Test Case: Verify that the user cannot create a booking without the Booking Status being “Pending”.
- Test Case: Verify that the validation warning “Similar Records Exist” appears after inputting a field has been duplicated when completing the form.
- Test Case: Verify that a new Booking Guest can be created using the previous Booking the user needs to fill out.
- Test Case: Verify that the Travel Package Selector displays packages that are currently recorded.
- Test Case: Verify that the statistics of selected widgets are displayed in any of the dashboards.
- Test Case: Verify that the user is able to create a feedback by filling all the mandatory fields inside the form.

Data Import Wizard was used to import sample data into Customer Info, TravelPackage, and Employee objects using CSV files with at least 20 records each. Fields were mapped correctly and the import status was verified through Bulk Data Load Jobs.

# *Phase 5*
**Deployment Strategy**
The system was deployed from the sandbox environment to the production org using Change Sets, which is the native Salesforce deployment tool. Custom objects, Apex classes, triggers, flows, Lightning pages, and permission sets were grouped into outbound change sets and validated in production before deployment. For metadata not supported by Change Sets (like Profiles or certain Sharing Settings), manual configuration and validation were performed post-deployment.

**System Maintenance and Monitoring**
The system will be maintained through regular updates based on feedback, new business requirements, or Salesforce seasonal releases. Scheduled reviews will ensure data accuracy and user access compliance. Debug Logs, System Overview, and Setup Audit Trail in Salesforce will be used to monitor performance and system activity.

**Troubleshooting Approach**
When issues arise, the following structured troubleshooting method is followed:
- Reproduce the issue to understand the exact error or behavior.
- Check debug logs and flow errors to identify failures in automation or Apex code.
- Use the Field History Tracking, Audit Trail, and Login History to trace user actions or permission issues.
- For data-related issues, analyze object data and relationships via SOQL queries in the Developer Console.
- If needed, escalate to Salesforce support or internal development team.

# *Conclusion*
The Tours & Travels CRM system was successfully developed, configured, and deployed using Salesforce best practices, ensuring a robust, scalable, and user-friendly platform tailored to the unique needs of the travel industry.
